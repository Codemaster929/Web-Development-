# using one value or variable of a js page into other js page

-it can be done using import , export 
- we export the value and use the import in the other js page to receive and work on that value 
- there are two types of export - 
    1. default export and 2. named export 
- in the default export , while importing an element any name can be used as there is only one element being exported
